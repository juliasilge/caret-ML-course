# Welcome to the course repo for **[Supervised machine learning with caret: case studies in R](https://caret-ml-course.netlify.app/)**! ðŸŽ‰ 

You can access [this course for free online](https://caret-ml-course.netlify.app/). 

This course approaches supervised machine learning using:

- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) tools
- [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/)
- a few [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) packages

This is the original version of my course; an updated version using [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) instead of caret is [available here](https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.com/). The interactive course site is built on the amazing framework created by [Ines Montani](https://ines.io/), originally built for her [spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io).  The front-end is powered by [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the
back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org). [Florencia D'Andrea](https://florencia.netlify.com/) helped port the course materials and made the fun logo.

To learn more about building a course on this framework, see Ines's starter repos for making courses in [Python](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) and [R](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r), and her explanation of how the framework works at [the original course repo](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course#-faq).
