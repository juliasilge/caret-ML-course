# VOTE 2016 üá∫üá∏

Notes: To do a good job with predictive modeling, you need to explore and understand your data before you start building machine learning models. When you do exploratory data analysis, you learn important things, such as how imbalanced the class you are trying to predict is...

# Exploratory data analysis


| | Elections don't matter | Gay rights are very important | Crime is very important |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Did not vote   | 55.3%                  | 17.0%                     | 66.3%  |                
| Voted          | 34.1%                  | 25.3%                     | 57.6%  |                

Notes: ...and how much of a difference you see in survey responses between the two groups. We see here that people who say that elections don't matter and things stay the same no matter who we vote in were less likely to vote, while people who think that gay rights are important were more likely to vote. We can see differences like this for many of the survey questions.

Notes: Visualizing your data before modeling is always a good idea. üëç Here, for example, we can see that people who say the economy is getting better are more likely to vote.

# Fitting a simple model

```r
simple_glm <- glm(turnout16_2016 ~ .,  family = "binomial", 
                  data = select(voters, -case_identifier))
 
summary(simple_glm)
```

```out
Call:
glm(formula = turnout16_2016 ~ ., family = "binomial", 
    data = select(voters, -case_identifier))

Notes: Another good step before you start training more complex models is to start with just the absolute, simplest model possible, to get your bearings and have a baseline for comparison. You also can use a model like this to understand which predictors are driving, in our case here, the likelihood of people to vote.

Notes: If you look at what these survey questions are, you'll see that when a respondent thinks that crime is an important issue, tabulated in the column `imiss_a_2016`, they are less likely to vote but when a respondent thinks that infrastructure improvements are an important issue, the column `imiss_n_2016`, they are more likely to vote.

Notes: Now that you have explored your data and have some understanding of it, it's time to move into preparing for machine learning.
